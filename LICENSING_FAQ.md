# Licensing FAQ

## Is internal SaaS infrastructure considered internal use?
No. If the infrastructure supports a revenue-generating service,
it is considered commercial use.

## What if customers never see the node?
Visibility is irrelevant. Revenue enablement constitutes commercial use.

## What if we are a startup?
Startups are commercial entities and require a commercial license.

## What if we only use one workflow?
Scope does not change license requirements.

## Do proof-of-concepts require a license?
Internal, non-customer-facing POCs are permitted.
Production SaaS deployments require a license.

## Can I use this for personal projects?
Yes. Personal, educational, and research use is permitted free of charge.

## Can I modify the code?
Yes. You may modify the code for permitted uses. Commercial use of
modified code still requires a commercial license.

## What happens after the Change Date?
After January 1, 2030, the code becomes available under the Apache License 2.0.

## How do I obtain a commercial license?
